# General points
- Visualisations have to be **INTERACTIVE**
- Visualisations need to be **COMPLEX**
	- intricate relationships/structures within the data
- Need to survey people with questionarre and user tasks on website, asking for design feedback
- Justify all your decisions


# Questions:
- Unit tests?
- What is 'Capture comprehensive informatoin about user demographics, motivations, and preferences'
